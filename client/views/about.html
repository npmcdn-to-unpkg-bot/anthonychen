	<h2>Present</h2>
	<p>
	  After courting my girlfriend for about a decade, we're finally married!  We bought a house together a year after I graduated from MIT and that led to several years of living together.  Although a lot of people tell me that this path is unusual I think that it worked for us.  I know couples that never lived together prior to getting married and that's pretty scary to me.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Together we have many pets.  We have chickens, guinea pigs, rabbits, and not to play favorites, a very cute and friendly mini poodle named Maki.
	</p>

	  In my free time, I continue to love to tinker.  I have a Struck Corp Magnatrac RS1000 with a backhoe and hydraulic bucket that I use from time to time to maintain the property and develop the land like putting in a vegetable garden.  I have a 4' x 8' CNC Router built from a kit from CNCRouterParts, which I haven't made that many things with yet.  I'm anxious to do more with it though.  I also have a 3D FDM Printer, the Ultimaker 2.  It's been super useful for custom fabricating parts for fixing or mounting things.  These are my favorite tools at the moment.  Read more about how I use them or why they're useful in the <a ui-sref="projects">projects</a> section.

	<h2>College Life</h2>
	<p>
	  My brother went to MIT about a decade before me so I had a lot to live up to.  Honestly, I had no idea if I'd make it or if college was even right for me.  I liked building things and cooking, I didn't like studying.  Four more years of studying?? Unthinkable!  My SAT scores were OK, my ACT score was OK, my SAT II scores were pretty good at 800 in every subject.  I wasn't top of my class.  Maybe it was the extracurriculars, teacher recommendations, or even the educational counselor interview that got me in.  I have no idea.  The first person I told when I found out I was accepted was my brother.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I paid for my own plane ticket and left for MIT with my PC (no monitor!) in my suitcase, padded with a pillow case and bedding that my mom got for me and some clothes.  I closed my bank account before leaving and I had a check with all my money.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Being away from home for the first time was both scary and liberating.  My childhood had prepared me to take care of myself but it was very weird and scary to think about things like feeding myself and putting a roof over my head.  I knew that once I left home I couldn't depend on my parents in anyway anymore.  I lived in the dorms on campus and cooked quite often.  I very much appreciated the many different companies that would show up on campus and run info sessions with food and give away free t-shirts.  That really got me through many days.  More than half of my wardrobe was made up of free t-shirts and by the time I graduated, I think 90% of my clothes were free t-shirts.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I really enjoyed my freshmen year.  I participated in clubs and was the vice president of the Association of Taiwanese Students (ATS).  It was really weird and exciting to go from Illinois suburbia where I knew maybe 6 asian people to having enough asian people in one place to have a club for each country.  I participated in intramural sports like volleyball and badminton and had a blast.  I also met my wife through ATS, though she's not even Taiwanese.   
	</p>
	<p>
	  Everything changed when I started working the spring of my first year at MIT.  I spent more time working than I spent in class.  It was tough, especially because I was also trying to develop a relationship with my girlfriend (now wife) since that winter.  First I cut out lectures, because I found that for most classes the lectures were much like reading from some presentation and often this did not align with the actual tests.  Recitations were very useful.  There were also some classes at MIT where the direct instruction was much more engaging, like Patrick Winston's 6.XXX in which I would always attend in person.  I'm sure there were many more interesting classes that I missed out on--unfortunately I'll never know but I believe that I made the best of the situation.  Just as I made time for awesome classes like 6.XXX, I would also never pass up the opportunity to do PE Volleyball.

	  Growing up with not much of anything, then being put forth into the world needing to pay subsidized tuition and to feed myself without working at the same time was unthinkable.  Although I could've asked for help from my siblings that really wasn't an option.  It wasn't that I wanted to be independent and do things on my own, it was more that I didn't want to burden other people.

	<h2>High School</h2>
	<p>
	  High school was transformative for me.  I think this is when I went way more into academics than ever before.  Before I just did my homework but I also played a lot.  In high school I embraced academics a lot more.  Science was my favorite and I wasn't that strong at math.  I remember trying to skip a year to Honors Algebra 2 but it didn't work out and I struggled a lot.  I tried again later of course and it went a lot better.  I had friends that wrapped up high school by taking multivariable calculus and I think my highest level of math was AP Calculus BC.  I liked the sciences a lot more instead, taking all the available AP sciences.  AP Physics C was not available in my school so I ended up doing an independent study, teaching myself out of the Giancoli Physics book.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Out of all the different scholastic competitions that I participated in, my favorite by far was the Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS) program.  Most competitions I had participated in were solo exams.  You'd get an exam, and then you'd do your best on it.  Your score was added up with the rest of your team and then that'd be the score for your school.  A lot of pressure!  I liked the JETS program a lot more because exams were team oriented and the problems were basically split up such that students could pair off to solve them.  The problems themselves were quite interesting.  I remember the last problem had to do with how to most efficiently and safely pack fuel cells in a container.  I thought that was so cool, to even be asked such a question!
	</p>
	<p>
	  I think that one of the most influential programs at my high school was the literacy center.  There, I was both a computer tutor and an academic tutor.  It was my first "official" position in helping my peers.  It was very rewarding for me and I think that if you can help others, you should.  It helps to have a school program that develops the skills necessary to teach as there are definitely strategies that can be learned to make the process more efficient.  In that same vein, I created my first website for sharing physics problem homework answers.  I was spending a lot of time explaining homework problems to my peers so I decided to just publish it as a website.  I also participated on IRC in EFNet's #physics channel, #math channel, and #chemistry channel in which I earned the trust of the community and became a moderator for every channel.  IRC sure was cool.  As a high school student I could talk to college people interested in the same subjects.  IRC was a fairly anonymous way to discuss things without much bias like you see in social media networks today.  I'm not sure which is better.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Although I became more and more involved in academics, I still did other things.  I played lots of computer games like Starcraft and Soldier of Fortune 2, but I wasn't that interested in programming at all.  My brother actually gave me a thick 2" book on Perl and I never made it past the first ten pages.  I also worked as a golf caddy on the weekends.  That was some really painful work.  Carrying someone's golf clubs, helping pick the right club, picking up divots from a bad swing, hoping for a good tip, cleaning the golf clubs...  Not the most fun thing to do.  My brother gave me my first break at remote work where I could do QA work for a company in Massachusetts from my home in Illinois.  That wasn't the most fun work either but it was worlds better than being a golf caddy.

	<h2>Early Childhood</h2>
	<p>
	  I was born shortly after my parents and siblings immigrated over to California from Taiwan.  My memory starts in Illinois at around the age of 4.  Both my parents worked pretty much all the time for minimum wage to raise the family.  I think that my dad got home at around 10PM or later everyday and my mom left for work around 6AM.  Year after year, my mom would remark about how she got a $0.05 raise per hour.  It's a whole different level of hard work.  My parents would never want me to.
	</p>
	<p>
	  My siblings are nearly a decade older than me so I felt very much like an only child at the age of 9.  I visited all my friends either by bike or by foot and back then I think it was perfectly acceptable for children to get around alone.  I used to read a lot and even spent a lot of time at the library.  My favorite books were of the Dragonlance series like The Legend of Huma and the Redwall series.  Now that I'm much older it's interesting to reflect upon how the heroes in those books may have shaped my view of the world and the principles that I live by.
